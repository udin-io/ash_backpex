# Changelog

<!-- changelog -->

## [v0.1.12]

### Updates

- Derive InlineCRUD child fields recursively from the child Ash resource,
  including field modules, relationship queries, and belongs-to typeaheads.
- Keep repeated child field components and typeahead searches scoped to their
  persistent row identity while entries are reordered.

## [v0.1.11]

### Fixes

- Remove the unused runtime Igniter dependency and its transitive `ex_ast`
  dependency.

## [v0.1.10]

### Updates

- Add opt-in, server-backed `typeahead true` support for `belongs_to` fields,
  including a configurable result limit, debouncing, and a Backpex-style
  searchable single-select dropdown.

## [v0.1.9]

### Updates

- Update Backpex to 0.19.6.
- Add opt-in `Backpex.Fields.InlineCRUD` support for `has_many`
  relationships, including `type` and a nested `child_fields` DSL.
- Add accessible move-up and move-down controls to InlineCRUD, repeat labels
  for every child form, and keep unsaved rows stable while reordering.
- Translate InlineCRUD add/delete/order parameters into ordered
  `manage_relationship` input and preserve existing child primary keys.
- Add a complete InlineCRUD demo and guide using article comments.

### Fixes

- Enforce Ash policies when the adapter persists create and update changesets.
- Restrict derived Backpex relationship options through an authorized Ash read
  when the destination resource has authorizers.

## [v0.1.8]

### Updates

- Derive Backpex relationship option queries from Ash relationship filters and sorts.
- Add a demo proof of concept with filtered topic and audience tag relationships.

### Fixes

- Handle Backpex option queries that already carry an Ecto root binding alias.

## [v0.1.7]

### Updates

- Add automatic `:many_to_many` relationship field derivation using `Backpex.Fields.HasMany`.
- Update the demo with article tags modeled as an Ash `many_to_many` relationship generated through Ash migrations.

## [v0.1.6]

### Fixes

- Remove the root Decimal override/dependency so the package can be published and consumers can resolve Decimal at the application level.
- Remove `mix_audit` because the current Backpex/number dependency graph requires top-level applications to own the Decimal 3 override.

## [v0.1.5]

### Fixes

- Add a Decimal 3 override to the demo app so its top-level dependency resolution matches the library audit fix.

## [v0.1.4]

### Updates

- Add `mix_audit` and run dependency auditing as part of `mix ci`.
- Refresh locked Ash dependencies and override Decimal to 3.x so dependency audits pass.

### Fixes

- Normalize blank list form values submitted by Backpex `HasMany` and `MultiSelect` fields before passing params into Ash changesets.

## [v0.1.3]

### Updates

- Bump Backpex dependency to 0.19.0.

### Fixes

- Fix index-editable fields by routing Backpex index updates through the configured AshBackpex changeset.

## [v0.1.2]

### Fixes

- Fix MultiSelect filters for SQLite-backed Ash array attributes.

## [v0.1.1]

### Updates

- Bump Backpex dependency to 0.18.0 and update AshBackpex for Backpex 0.18 filter and adapter compatibility.
- Add usage rules to the package for LLM-assisted development workflows.
- Expand the demo app with authors, comments, relationships, item actions, panels, filters, and richer sample data.

## [v0.1.0]
